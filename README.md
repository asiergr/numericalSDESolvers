# numericalSDESolvers
This is a combination of C++ programs and Python scripts used to find numeric solutions for Stochastic Differential Equations.

## TODO:
* General Euler-Maruyama Method to work for any SDE
* Implement Milstein method
* Call C++ function directly from Python instead of I/O to file
* OO approach
